    <h1>Homemade burgers</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g chicken meat</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>All or any of the following to serve: sliced tomato, beetroot, horseradish sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, handful iceberg lettuce, rocket, watercress</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip 500g chicken meat into a bowl with 1 small diced onion and 1 egg, then mix.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into four. Roll the mixture into balls, each about the size of a tennis ball with wet hands.</li>
        <li>Set in the palm of your hand and gently squeeze down to flatten into patties about 3cm thick.</li>
        <li>Put on a plate, cover with cling film and leave in the fridge to firm up for at least 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Heat the barbecue to medium hot. Lightly brush one side of each burger with vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Place the burgers, oil-side down, on the barbecue. Cook for 5 mins until the meat is lightly charred.</li>
        <li>Oil the other side, then turn over using tongs. Don't press down on the meat, as that will squeeze out the juices.</li>
        <li>Cook for 5 mins more for medium. If you like your burgers pink in the middle, cook 1 min less each side. For well done, cook 1 min more.</li>
        <li>Take the burgers off the barbecue. Leave to rest on a plate so that all the juices can settle inside.</li>
        <liL>Slice four burger buns in half. Place, cut-side down, on the barbecue rack and toast for 1 min until they are lightly charred. Place a burger inside each bun, then top with your choice of accompaniment.</li>
